# Will Will Catch You?

This is a VR game in which you, the player, are being chased by a hot air balloon with Will Smith's face on it. Progress through different environements while you dodge cars, collect powerups, and of course, run away from Will Smith! This is a collaborative project that my friends and I have been working on since March and will be continuing to develop and update, so stay tuned!
